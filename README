I implemented all required features of the shell specified by the prompt

A known issue with my shell is that there are file descriptor and memory leaks

The additional features that I implemented are the variable prompt and on_error statements
changing the environment variable "PROMPT" will print a new prompt. Changing the environment variable
"ON_ERROR" will change the error message printed by an unsuccessful command.
